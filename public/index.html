			<h1>ü¶´ Capybara</h1>

			<h1>üê± Kitten</h1>
			<p>Kittens are young domestic cats, typically under one year of age. These adorable creatures are born after a gestation period of approximately 64-67 days, usually in litters of 2-5. Kittens are born blind and deaf, opening their eyes at around 7-10 days old. They're incredibly playful and curious, using play to develop their hunting skills and social behaviors. Kittens purr when they're content and have an amazing ability to land on their feet due to their righting reflex. They require lots of love, care, and attention as they grow.</p>

			<h1>üê∞ Bunny</h1>
			<p>Bunnies, or rabbits, are small mammals known for their long ears, fluffy tails, and powerful hind legs. They're herbivores that love munching on grass, vegetables, and hay. Rabbits are incredibly social animals that live in groups called colonies in the wild. They communicate through various sounds, body language, and even by thumping their hind feet to warn others of danger. Bunnies can jump up to 3 feet high and run up to 35 mph when needed. They're also known for their prolific breeding, which is where the phrase "breeding like rabbits" comes from.</p>

			<h1>üêß Penguin</h1>
			<p>Penguins are flightless birds that have adapted to life in the water. These tuxedo-wearing birds are found primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, with the largest populations in Antarctica. They're excellent swimmers, using their wings as flippers to propel themselves through water at speeds up to 22 mph. Penguins are highly social and often huddle together for warmth in harsh conditions. They're devoted parents, with many species taking turns incubating eggs and caring for their chicks. Despite their formal appearance, penguins are quite playful and have been observed sliding on their bellies for fun!</p>
